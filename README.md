## About

Using existing tech it is possible to fake a website that phishes for the user's location without revealing itself as a fake / malicious app. The user is presented with a webpage that can be templated to match target audience, upon interacting the user is asked to share location data before proceeding further. This jailbaiting can be customised using simple HTML designing. Those who click, give up their location data. The technique can be employed to gather user location data and start making a database. Further extensions can include : -

  1.  Deliveries made via SMS
  2.  Geoplotting results
  3.  Morphing into a service for continued updates
  4.  etc...
